This is an example on how to use the `quarkus-jte-extension`.

Unfortunately doing tests with this extension are broken, but contributions are very welcome.

== Running

First make sure that you have the `quarkus-jte-extension` locally, so go to the root of this
repository and run:

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

```shell
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

== Accessing the endpoint
